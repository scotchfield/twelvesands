<p>Dearest <i>(illegible)</i>:</p>
<p>It is with a heavy heart that I must write to you with this news.
Our city is not as safe as it once was.  I fear the worst for the family,
and for the farm.  <i>(illegible)</i> and upon their arrival, we could

us who tried to fend them off, but we were no match.  They are tireless!
It didn't take long, but <i>(illegible)</i></p>
<p><i>(illegible)</i> and I still think of you often.  I may never see
your beautiful face again.  Take care of yourself.</p>

<p>Civilized minds argued over many things, but one source of agreement
was the value of a centralized hub for trading.  While merchants and
hagglers across the land sought out new vistas in an effort to profit
from their trade, those who set up a foothold near the Goldstone Tower
were able to pool their knowledge about prices, and benefited greatly
from the collected wisdom of a group of like-minded individuals.</p>

<p>In earlier years, the youth of the land, tied to the immaturity of the
majority of its traders, led to great profits for the racketeers gathering
in the area.  As the local merchants realized the power of the collective,
and began to work together, more and more finance began to develop.  After
a time, a grand spire was erected in order to prominently display the fact
that could not be denied; those at Goldstone were the heart of the
region's economy.</p>
<?
        break;
    case 520:

<p>Years passed, and for a time, it was good.  Goldstone Tower thrived due
to its proximity to several major residences, and the strength of its
traders allowed reasonable prices to derive from the vast amount of
stock passing through the doors.  Those at the ground level kept a busy
pace, shipping and receiving goods as fast as the couriers could relay
information.  Those at the top level profited like few others in history.
All led frantic lifestyles, extravagant, and luxurious.</p>

<p>The region was well guarded, which may be seen as obvious, due to the
quantity of gold passing through the region.  Several instances of minor
uprisings occurred, but were swiftly dealt with.  The guard was powerful,
and certainly well paid, so loyalty and security were never an issue.
What sort of army could cause any sort of impact on the most powerful
economic force in the region?  How naive we were..  In retrospect,
everyone has perfect vision, don't they..</p>

<p>When Omor's Firestorm finally erupted from the mighty citadel, it
caught everyone off-guard.  We knew it was coming, but what could we
have possibly done to prevent it?  What could anyone have done, save
for the Twelve?  It was their battle to fight, and alas, it was ours
to lose.  Goldstone fell into ruin, and with our fiercest instincts for
survival intact, we fled to whatever sanctuary would hold us.  Those who
survived clung to whatever bastions of hope were left.  As fire rained
from the sky, we hid.  We hid in caves, and when the earth was scorched,
we hid in whatever secured us from the firestorm.</p>

<p>What is left of the world is truly and honestly unknown to me.  I do
not matter, in the grand scheme of things.  I can only hope that this
message reaches those who would see it, and learn from the events that
transpired.  The world has been born anew, and though I have little idea
of the geography of the globe, I know our region has been scorched.  I
will wait, by the Tower.  This was the land that I knew, and the only
land I can call home.  Let the lives here not be lost in vain.</p>

<p><i>The page is somewhat torn, but you are able to make out the following
text.</i></p>

<p>.. We know them as the Tyen, and the Delann, the demons who were drawn
by the firestorms that scorched these sands.  They emerged from whatever
unnatural dwelling they last claimed, and now seek something here that we
still don't understand.  What limited artifacts were retrievable before
their invastion have been of little help.</p>

<p>The Tyen are similar to the imps, jesters and pranksters.  They are
cruel and wicked, and take great joy in the misery and pain of others.</p>

<p>The Delann are brutal, calculating, and vastly intelligent.  They are
known to kill with ruthless efficiency.</p>

<p>We have seen additional demons roaming around, but we are not equipped
for battle, and anyone who had encountered them up close has not returned
to tell the tale..</p>
