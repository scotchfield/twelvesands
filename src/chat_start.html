<p><b>March 7:</b> If you don't think that the score you gave a creation
in the World Builder is appropriate, you can now clear it to add a new
one.</p>

<p><b>March 7:</b> User plots have a few additions available in the
Starfall Exchange.  Watch for more in the next few days!</p>

<p><b>March 5:</b> You can leave additional comments on a world builder
creation after you've voted, and the number of characters have been
increased.</p>

<p><b>March 1:</b> The quick nav menu has been cleaned up a little bit;
please let me know if you think there are options missing, or options that
don't need to be there!</p>

<p><b>February 26:</b> The first player-designed artifact has gone into
the game!  Hurray, World Builder!</p>

<p><b>February 25:</b> Have a go at creating your own Twelve Sands
content with the <span class="hand" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;" onclick="parent.parent.main_frame.location='builder.php'">World
Builder</span>!  The Artifact Builder is now live, and you are
encouraged to begin creating items that you'd like to see in the
game.  Got an idea for a new weapon?  A strange food with a neat
effect?  Toss it into the Artifact Builder, and let other players
discuss how it would improve the game!  Be creative, and let me know
what you think!</p>

<p><b>February 24:</b> The quick navigation menu has been replaced with
a drop-down menu to consolidate some of the options.</p>

<p><b>February 24:</b> A few <span class="hand" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;" onclick="parent.parent.main_frame.location='main.php?z=140'">new
properties</span> have started to show up along the coasts.  If you
are interested in becoming a land owner, keep an eye on the Auction
House!</p>

<p><b>February 22:</b> The Starfall Bay Trading Company has begun to
develop land near the water, and they sure seem to be making a lot of
noise.  Even the profile pages have shifted slightly.</p>

<p><b>February 20:</b> A new page has been added to show the full list of
zones, ordered by level.  If you're having trouble finding a place to
adventure,  <span class="hand" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;" onclick="parent.parent.main_frame.location='zonelevel.php'">take a look</span>!</p>
